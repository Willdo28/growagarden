You are a senior front‑end engineer and UI/UX lead.
Generate a production‑quality static website (no backend required) with index.html + style.css + app.js that sells Grow a Garden items.
Design language: Block/Brick UI (lego‑like bricks, chunky rounded rectangles, bold labels), clean typography, high contrast, soft shadows, playful micro‑interactions. Do not use product images. Use text, emoji, and brick‑style placeholders.

Goals
	1.	Ultra‑clean, professional storefront with Home, Shop, Cart/Checkout (stub), FAQ, Contact/Discord, Policy pages.
	2.	No images for products—cards show name, badges, prices, savings, and “Add to Cart” only.
	3.	Discord CTA: persistent button and a “Join our Discord” section.
	4.	Smooth, tasteful animations consistent with the game’s style (no heavy libs).
	5.	Fully responsive (mobile‑first), accessible (ARIA, focus states, keyboard nav).
	6.	Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks/packages/CDNs.

Brand & Style
	•	Name: The Garden Vault (you can also mention Grow a Garden in copy).
	•	Palette: leaf green, sky blue, soil brown, brick red, gold accents.
	•	Fonts: system UI or a single web‑safe stack.
	•	Components look like stacked bricks/blocks with a subtle stud/brick texture using pure CSS (no external images).
	•	Buttons: chunky, rounded 10–14px radius, bold labels, hover “lift” + tiny bounce.
	•	Badges: rectangular “stud” chips (e.g., “24H SALE”, “Limited Deal”).
	•	Icons: text/emoji only (🌱🐝🧱💎), no image files.

Pages & Sections
	•	Header/Nav: logo text at left; links: Home, Shop, FAQ, Policies, Contact. Right side: Search, Cart (item count), Join Discord button.
	•	Hero (Home): tagline, short description, “Shop Deals” and “Join Discord” buttons.
	•	Highlights: three bricks for “24H Sales”, “Sheckles Deals”, “All Pets”.
	•	Shop (main): tabs or filters for Sales, Sheckles Deals, All Pets (with sub‑filters Limited Deals and Regular Pets).
	•	Product Card (no image):
	•	Name (bold), optional emoji, badges, original price struck, sale price prominent, auto % saved, “Add to Cart” button, tiny note (e.g., “Delivery via in‑game trade/terms”).
	•	Keyboard accessible; button shows toast “Added to cart”.
	•	Cart/Checkout (stub): list items, qty +/- , remove, subtotal, fees (0), total, “Proceed” (disabled by default with note “Checkout handled via Discord or in‑game—see instructions”).
	•	Discord CTA: large brick block with copy + button.
	•	FAQ: delivery method, timing, refunds, safety.
	•	Policies: Terms, Privacy, Refunds (simple text pages).
	•	Footer: links + small disclaimer: “Not affiliated with Roblox. Virtual items only.”

Interactions & Animations
	•	Page transitions: fade/slide 150–250ms.
	•	Buttons: hover lift (translateY‑2px) + shadow; active press (translateY1px).
	•	Tabs/filters: animated underline.
	•	Toasters for cart events.
	•	Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility
	•	Semantic HTML landmarks.
	•	Labels for all controls; ARIA where needed.
	•	Focus rings clearly visible.
	•	All actions keyboard‑operable.

Performance/SEO
	•	Single request per file; inline minimal SVG only if needed.
	•	Meta title/description, OpenGraph, favicon as data URL if needed.
	•	Defer JS, minify where reasonable.

Data & Logic

Load the catalog from a constant JS array (below).
Features: search, category chips, sort (Price ↑/↓, Savings %, A→Z), and filters (Sales / Sheckles / Limited / Regular).
Compute savings% = (oldPrice − price) / oldPrice. Format prices in USD with 2 decimals where needed.

Catalog (use exactly these items and prices)
